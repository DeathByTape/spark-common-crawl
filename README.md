Misc. Spark Common Crawl
========================

Some miscellaneous examples of using Spark to analyze some common-crawl data.

The original use of these scripts were for some simple evaluations. Use them at
your own risk and for an example of how to work with the data.

I copied the common-crawl datasets from s3 to a local hdfs cluster.
